To simulate a multi-server processing system (using consensus based Bully algorithm) to allow for the processing of a book (or text file) across multiple systems. The resulting cloud software will take as input a single text document, split the data across multiple systems, process the data (respective of the multiple systems) and return information on the document (e.g. word count) to the end user
